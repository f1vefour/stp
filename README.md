## What

Session Teleporter lets you copy a logged in session from your phone to
an untrusted desktop browser, eliminating the need to enter your
password on the untrusted browser.

## How

By copying the cookies from phone, encrypting them with a random
password, uploading them to a very forgetful server. By entering the
password in the desktop browser, you are automagically logged in.

## Is it safe?

NO! It's not. Frankly you shouldn't use it. If you're confused why it's
here at all, then you should leave immediately. You'll only get yourself
into unnecessary trouble.
